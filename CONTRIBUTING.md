# Contributing to VyOS

You wan't to help us improve VyOS? This is awesome. We accept any kind of Pull
Requests on GitHub. To make the life of the maintainers and you as future
contributor (or maybe maintainer) much easier we have come up with some basic
rules. Instead of copy/pasting or maintaining two instances of how to contribute
to VyOS you can find the entire process documented in our online documentation:
https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/contributing/development.html

Also this guide might not be complete so any PR is much appreciated.

It might also worth browsing our blog: https://blog.vyos.io
